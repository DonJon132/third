                        itty bitty hehe I hope we will get through this relationship being apart and not seeing each other. I hope your love for me will not fade. 
                        I hope we will get past this with you still by my side. I'm sorry baby, this is all I can do for now, given our situation huhu

                    <h3>Te quiero con toda mi alma</h3>
                    <p> Looking back at our memories makes me smile babe. I would do anything to relive those moments with you. 
                        I can’t wish for a better lover than you, because you made love live in my heart again. Even on our bad days, 
                        boring days and almost-breaking-up days, I loved you, and I loved you even more to this day. It's all beyond my comprehension
                         what I did right to deserve you hehe I wish I knew so I could continue to do it to keep you in my life. Nevertheless,
                          with everything in me, I will continue to be me, and love you with all my heart. <br><br>
                          I know I am a pain in the ass and a headache to you sometimes but know this babe, I am trying to tone it down because
                          I don't like fighting with you and you know why hehe.

                    <h3>Tienes los ojos más bonitos del mundo</h3>
                    <p>I am sick and tired of not seeing you each day, my love. To aid this love sick of mine, I made the small version of me 
                        hug the small version of you hehe at least I can hug you in my own small way. I think this is the coolest and cutest 
                        gif i have ever made hehe <br><br> I have never been the kind of person who is longing for someone's warmth and prescence but 
                    when you came to my life, It's like I can't get enough of you. Your hugs, your kisses and your lambing. You have been an amazing 
                    girlfriend to me, caring and most especially, loving. You know the right things to do and the right words to say to me. I can’t 
                    imagine a life without you because you are the best out of the rest. <br><br> I hope to be with you real soon, baby!
